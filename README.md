At present this workbench includes two different functionalities:

### Shear Punching
This reads an excel output from CSI Safe software and calculate shear punching ratio. 

### Sections
This converts a combined steel section to one standard section (I shape) to be imported in CSI Etabs for checking classification of compact level of section.
